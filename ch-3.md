## Shea

**What I learned**
- Iterables: I've never thought deeply about this topic...
  - Strings are iterables ðŸ¤¯
  - 3 form, `.keys`, `.values`, `.entries`
- Closure:
  - I like this definition:
    > Closure is when a function remembers and continues to access variables from outside its scope, even when the function is executed in a different scope.

- `this` Keyword
  - Is still confusing ðŸ˜‚
  - But here is now I see it now with the idea of execution context
    ```js
    function classroom(teacher) {
        return function study() {
            console.log(
                `${ teacher } says to study ${ this.topic }`
            );
        };
    }
    var assignment = classroom("Kyle");
    
    assignment(); 
    //Kyle says to study undefined  -- Oops :(
    
    // unless the global window has "topic"
    let topic = "Global Topic"
    assignment();
    // Kyle says to study Global Topic
    
    var homework = {
    topic: "JS",
    assignment: assignment
    };

    // homework is the execution context
    homework.assignment();
    // Kyle says to study JS
    
    var otherHomework = {
        topic: "Math"
    };

    // other homework is now the executionContext.
    assignment.call(otherHomework);
    // Kyle says to study Math
    ```

**What I Liked**
- Mention of how important closures are!  Eric Elliot considers closures a key interview question.

**Questions for the Group**

## Shipeng

**What I learned**
- Iteration: It reminds me the old good time at college learning design patterns, iterator was the first patten I'v leaned! spread operator and map are very similar to what's in GO.
- Clousure: Objects don't get closures, functions do. They are a direct link and preservation of the variable itself.
- This: is a characteristic of function execution, a function that is dependent on its execution context.
- Prototypes: is a characteristic of an object, and specifically resolution of a property access.

**What I need**
- More design pattern examples in JS please.

**Questions**
- Do we use Prototypes linkage a lot in DC UI? It sounds like a lighweight class inheritance, although it does compares class vs prototypal class in Appendix A.
