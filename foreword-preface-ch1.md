# Overview
Highlights from the Foreward, Preface, and Chapter 1: What Is JavaScript?

## Foreword

### Shea

- Great Perspective heading in to the book!
- If this how the head of VS Code/Node on Azure feels... I will definitely learn sometime!
> ...it's for all software craftspeople who want to master their tools...

### Annie
- Nice intro into the book, since people picking up the book most likely already know some degree of JS.  
- It gives a peak of the take away that you'll definitely learn something, even if someone think they already know everything about JS!  So.. read on! 

### Shipeng
- After reading I feel I probably don't know JS yet. 
- It's a good book to build up a solid fundation by explaining fundamental concepts. 

## Preface

### Shea

- Note JavaScript the Good Parts! Informed much of my JS view
- Note History and how JS was created. [Fireship.io video](https://fireship.io/courses/javascript/intro-history/)
- 

### Annie
- It's a journey....

### Shipeng
- Exploring all the parts
- Respect the language

## Chapter 1: What is JavaScript

### Shea

- Interesting the JS which run on your machine/browser is only an implemenation of the standard
- Language Specification... 
  - "Don't break the web"
  - DevTools/console aren't completely consistent with JS spec... just "js friendly" tools
- May Faces: Remember JS is a multi-paradigm language.  Paradigms are not good or bad, but guide the problem solving process.
- Compatability: JS is backwards compatible.  CSS, HTML forward compatabile. Valid HTML/CSS in 2001 might not work now as expected,  while 2020 features applied to the 2001 era would just be skipped over.
- Forward compatabilty, Gaps, Babel, Transpiling, etc
  > Developers should focus on writing the clean, new syntax forms, and let the tools take care of producing a forwards-compatible version of that code that is suitable to deploy and run on the oldest-supported JS engine environments.

- WASM
  > But let me just state simply: WASM will not replace JS. WASM significantly augments what the web (including JS) can accomplish. That's a great thing, entirely orthogonal to whether some people will use it as an escape hatch from having to write JS.

- Concludes with a really great summary!  See the Defined section

### Annie
- The Web Rules Everything
- alert() & console.log() is not JS!!
- Backward vs Foreward compatibility.
- JS is Complied language
- try use "strict" mode more....

### Shipeng
- JavaScript is most definitely a multi-paradigm language
- Transpiler and Polyfill for addressing gap
- Use the most recent stable JS version and newest syntax
- WASM will not replace JS
