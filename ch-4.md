**What I learned**

- Pillar 1: Scope and Closure
  Hoisting!  OMG Hositing!  With the addition of `let` and `const` hoisting has been much less discussed.  I suspect [Kyle Simpson](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/4c6b88f842694b3784b32024b552b7f07fb5f1fa/get-started/ch2.md?plain=1#L264) disagress with [Eric Elliot](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/javascript-es6-var-let-or-const-ba58b8dcde75) on use of `let` vs `const`.  But something worth thinking about from time to time.  I hadn't hear the term "Temporal Dead Zone".
  
  [Simpson's recommendation for `const`](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/4c6b88f842694b3784b32024b552b7f07fb5f1fa/get-started/ch2.md?plain=1#L264)
  > The best semantic use of a `const` is when you have a simple primitive value that you want to give a useful name to, such as using `myBirthday` instead of `true`. This makes programs easier to read.
